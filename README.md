# AOC 2022
My solutions to Advent of Code 2022. This repo is primarily rust and nix, although I might branch out to Python or C++ depending.

## cargo-generate
I will attempt to use
[cargo-generate](https://docs.rs/cargo-generate/latest/cargo_generate/) to
speed up creation of projects per day.

```bash
cargo generate --path <>
```
